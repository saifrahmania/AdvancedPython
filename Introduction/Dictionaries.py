# 4. Dictionaries
# Python's dictionaries are kind of hash table type. They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.

dict = {}
dict['one'] = "This is one"
dict[2] = "This is two"
print(dict['one'])
print(dict[2])
print(dict)
