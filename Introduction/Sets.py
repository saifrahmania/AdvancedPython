# 2. Sets
# A set is an unordered collection of items. Every set element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (cannot be changed). However, a set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it.

# Sets can be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, symmetric difference etc.

set = { 'A', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'A'}
print(set)
